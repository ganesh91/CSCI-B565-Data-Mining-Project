## Tentative Plan
1. Load data into a relational database
2. Write equations that capture each aspect of the existing system based on data
3. Identify relevant indirect features of data (difference between actual time and scheduled time etc)
4. Transform (and add) data based on equations so that we capture all indirect system properties 
5. Find all features that we want to improve or create
6. Implement and test each feature
